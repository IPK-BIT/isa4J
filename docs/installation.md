# Installation
The isa4J library is available from the Central Maven Repository: https://search.maven.org/artifact/de.ipk-gatersleben/isa4J
Click on the version you want to download (we recommend using the latest version unless you have specific reasons not to) and then either download the jar manually by clicking on the *Downloads* button or include the snippet on the right in your build management tool configuration file (Maven, Gradle, Ivy...).
